# LLVM-Assisted Reassembly: Improving 3D Reassembly for Real-World Fractures

This project explores methods to improve the **GARF** 3D reassembly framework using LLVM-assisted workflows, semantic segmentation, and realistic fracture data. It consists of two major contributions:

1. Participation in the original [GARF](https://github.com/ai4ce/GARF) project.
2. Novel extensions to GARF to improve performance on real-world fracture data.

## 📌 Overview

- **GARF** is a generalizable flow-matching-based method for 3D fragment reassembly.
- This repository showcases **my extended work** built upon GARF, with a focus on:
  - Integrating **3D segmentation-aware features** using SAMPart3D
  - Generating **high-fidelity fractured datasets** using physically-based simulations (FractureRB, FractureBEM)

---

## 🧩 Part 1: Contributions to GARF

The source code of the original GARF project is available here:  
👉 [https://github.com/ai4ce/GARF](https://github.com/ai4ce/GARF)

My contributions (not included in this repo for privacy and modularity) include:
- Designing a visualization tool for animating the flow-matching transformation process
- Data preprocessing and unification for mesh fragments
- Benchmark evaluation and dataset curation

🚧 *Note: The visualization tool will be open-sourced soon—stay tuned!*

## 🔁 Part 2: LLVM-Based Improvements

### 🔷 Direction 1: Recursive Pipeline with SAMPart3D

This method proposes a **self-improving pipeline** that combines:
- Initial reassembly from GARF
- Feature augmentation using SAMPart3D's segmentation-aware embeddings
- Recursive refinement based on updated semantic feedback

#### Resources:
- GARF: [https://github.com/ai4ce/GARF](https://github.com/ai4ce/GARF)
- Folder: `SAMPart3D/` — contains implementation of the first two stages of SAMPart3D
- Testing data: `SAMPart3D/mydata/` — includes `.glb` model inputs

---

### 🔷 Direction 2: Physically-Based Dataset Generation

This direction improves reassembly training data using **realistic fracture surfaces** generated by:
- [FractureRB](https://github.com/Chenyang-Joe/FractureRB-CX) — deployed using Docker (repository maintained here)

Check the repo for:
- 🐳 `Dockerfile` and runtime scripts
- Setup instructions for reproducing simulation environments
- Sample fracture scenes and meshes
